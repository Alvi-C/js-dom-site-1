                            <span class="font-bold">Function Scope:</span> Variables declared with var are
                            function-scoped. This means they are only accessible within the function
                            in which they are declared. If a variable is declared within a block (e.g., an if statement
                            or loop), it is still accessible throughout the entire function. <br>
                            <span class="font-bold">Hoisting:</span> Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top
                            of their containing function or global scope. This means you can access and use a var
                            variable before it's declared in your code, although the value
                            will be undefined until the assignment is reached.

                            <span class="font-bold">Block Scope:</span> Like let, variables declared with const are
                            block-scoped, and their scope is limited to the block in which they are
                            defined. <br>
                            <span class="font-bold">No Hoisting:</span> Unlike var, variables declared with let are not
                            hoisted. They are only accessible after they have been declared in the
                            code. Trying to access a let variable before its declaration will result in a
                            ReferenceError.

                            <span class="font-bold">Constant Value:</span> Variables declared with const are constant,
                            meaning their value cannot be reassigned after initialization. However, for
                            objects and arrays declared with const, their properties or elements can still be modified.

                            <span class="font-bold">No Hoisting:</span> Like let, const variables are not hoisted, and
                            they must be declared before they are used.

                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            A REST API is an architectural style for an application program interface (API) that uses
                            HTTP requests to access and
                            use data. That data can be used to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data types, which refers to the
                            reading, updating, creating
                            and deleting of operations concerning resources.

                            An API for a website is code that allows two software programs to communicate with each
                            other. The API spells out the
                            proper way for a developer to write a program requesting services from an operating system
                            or other application.
